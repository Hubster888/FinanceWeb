		<h2 id="sectionTitle">2) Saving</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p1">
			You ready for the fun stuff?
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p2">
			The taxes briefly covered above will most likely be the most impactful for you. One other important tax not mentioned before is VAT which is covered in the savings guide of the personal finance course.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p3">
			You and me are going to take a quick trip through a list of ways to weaken that slap of tax.
		</div>
		<h2 id="taxCode">Check Youre Tax Code</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p4">
			It's not always the case that you're paying the right amount.
			Every time your income changes its important to double check your still in the right tax bracket and if not, inform whoever handles your income tax (usually your employer).
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p5">
			This here is a no-brainer way to save that cash.
		</div>
		<h2 id="taxCredits">Tax Credits</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p6">
			In short, tax credits are pay-outs from the government to people that need it. Not checking if your eligible for these is just leaving money on the table.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p7">
			There are two types of tax credit, child tax credit and working tax credit.
			I highly recommend checking here if you meet the requirements for either the child tax credit or the working tax credit especially if your struggling, after all that’s what they're there for.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p8">
			Applications for tax credit are handled by HMRC and you can find all the info you need right here.
		</div>
		<h2 id="pension">Payments Into Pension Scheme</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p9">
			A pension scheme is like finding that £5 in your pocket except it’s more like £500,000.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p10">
			If you don’t want to be broke the minute you stop working then investment into your pension scheme is one of the best choices.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p11">
			Most forms of saving are highly taxable but payments into your pension scheme minimise any taxes you have to pay. Besides saving on taxes, who doesn't want to be absolutely balling when they retire.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p12">
			Now I know it's going to be a long time before you see that money again and it may feel like losing a bunch of disposable income, so don’t pay in any money you rely on.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p13">
			For more info on retirement and pensions visit the section of this website dedicated to just that.
		</div>
		<h2 id="councilTax">Reduction In Council Tax</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p14">
			If you're on low income, it’s a good chance you can get a reduction in the council tax you're paying.
			This is not some dodgy magic it just help from your friends up in the government to help you get by so why not give it try.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p15">
			There are a few basic requirements such as that you must live in the property you're applying for reductions, but there is a bunch of other requirements which can be found here.
		</div>
		<div id="pic1"></div>
		<div id="pic2"></div>
		<h2 id="isa">Open An ISA</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p16">
			An ISA, in my opinion, is even better than a pension. Not only almost anyone can have one but you can invest up to £20,000 tax free per year.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p17">
			The only problems I see is that on an ISA the contributions are payed after the income tax and also the ISA has some risks with it.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p18">
			There is so much to be said about ISAs and other investments that I recommend you have a look at the investments section of this website.
		</div>
		<h2 id="cgt">Capital Gains Tax Saving</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p19">
			Firstly, it's important to know that you don’t pay any CGT until you have passed the £12,000, after that the taxes get a little large.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p20">
			Lucky for you there are a few basic ways to save on CGT:
		</div>
		<ul id="list">
			<li class="listItem">Move assets to someone with little assets to make use of the allowance.</li>
			<li class="listItem">Contribute the gains to an ISA or pension scheme. </li>
			<li class="listItem">Spread the profits over multiple tax years to take advantage of your allowance. </li>
			<li class="listItem">Take some losses to bring down your net profit. </li>
		</ul>
		<div id="pic3"></div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p21">
			Remember, when it comes to saving on taxes there isn't that much you can do (legally) other than pay attention and make sure your paying the right amount. However,
			doing the things listed above and some others can save you tons of money as I will demonstrate in the next part of the course.
