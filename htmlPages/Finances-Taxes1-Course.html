		<h2 id="sectionTitle">1) Introduction</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p1">
			You know you pay taxes; you probably complain about them on a regular but what do you really know about them?
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p2">
			I’ve constructed this short guide just for you, attempting to explain some basic concepts and to plant some ideas in your head so you can effortlessly save your hard-earned money.
		</div>
		<div id="leftQuote"></div>
		<div id="googleQuote">
			a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers' income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions. - Google
		</div>
		<div id="rightQuote"></div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p3">
			To begin with, you're going to have to understand what taxes are and which ones you're paying. Don’t worry, I'll keep it short so you can move on to saving that dough.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p4">
			The definition above can be a bit confusing, really tax is what you pay to the government so that they can provide the much-needed public services such as the NHS and the welfare system.
			Taxes are mostly collected by the HMRC and your local council.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p5">
			So, what are you paying, how are you paying and how can you pay less? Read on...
		</div>
		<h2 id="incomeTax">Income Tax</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p6">
			You remember how excited you were to get that very first pay check as a teen?
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p7">
			Do you also remember how your jaw dropped when you saw how much was taken straight from your pocket?
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p8">
			That right there was a hard slap of the dreaded income tax.
		</div>
		<div id="sadImg"></div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p9">
			There is a whole list of scenarios where you pay income tax and when you don’t, they can be conveniently found here.
			But to get the general idea you need to know which bracket you fit in to and more importantly which one you're paying which can be found just below.
		</div>
		<table id="customers">
			<tr>
				<th>Band</th>
				<th>Taxable Income</th>
				<th>Tax Rate</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Personal Allowance</td>
				<td>Up to £12,500 </td>
				<td>0% </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Basic Rate</td>
				<td>£12,501 to £50,000</td>
				<td>20%</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Higher Rate</td>
				<td>£50,001 to £150,000</td>
				<td>40%</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Additional rate</td>
				<td>over £150,000</td>
				<td>45%</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p10">
			Pay attention to that personal allowance level, if your bellow it, all that cash is yours.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p11">
			(Unfortunately, since your tax payment is automatically handled by your employer, the bracket you're in might not be the one you're paying. If they don’t match, they need to be fixed.)
		</div>
		<h2 id="NIC">National Insurance Contributions (NIC)</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p12">
			Not all taxes have to make you reconsider moving to the mountains to live off wild berries. Next up we have the NIC.
		</div>
		<div id="hungryPic"></div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p13">
			Unlike most others, this tax works directly for your benefit granting you access to benefits and a state pension.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p14">
			(The list of benefits based on which class you’re in can be found here.)
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p15">
			You start paying the NIC when you turn 16 and are either employed making £183 or more a week,
			or self-employed and making £6,475 or more per year. The amount payed is determined by which class you’re in and here is a link where you can determine where you fit in.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p16">
			Lucky for you the NIC is handled the same way as your income tax, by your employer.
		</div>
		<h2 id="CGT">Capital Gains Tax</h2>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p17">
			This is an important one for investors, it’s the tax payed on the profit of selling an asset.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p18">
			You may want to also be aware that there is a tax-free allowance of £12,300 or £6,150 for trusts and not all assets are taxable. A list on tax-free assets can be found here.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p19">
			In my opinion the easiest way to pay the CGT is through your annual self-assessment tax return, however there are a few other methods to go about it.
		</div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="p20">
			As for the amount they take from you, it will be either 10% or 20% depending on which tax bracket you are in. This changes to 18% or 28% for residential property.
